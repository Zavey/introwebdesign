    <font size="+2"> <p>A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the
      garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they
      began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this,
      and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but
      about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son
      was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the
      third son oered to keep watch; but the gardener at rst would not let him, for fear some harm should come to
      him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck
      twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came ying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping
      at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the
      bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then ew away. The golden feather was
      brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth
      more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no use to me, I must have the
      whole bird.’</p>

      <p>Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to nd the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone
      but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made
      ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business
      is, and that you want to nd the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get
      there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not
      in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.’ But the son
      thought to himself, ‘What can such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at the fox; but
      he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening
      came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and
      feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby
      house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot
      the bird, and his country too.</p>

      <p>Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set
      out, and the same thing happened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to
      the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to
      come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in
      the same manner.</p>

      <p>Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden
      bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that
      some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should
      go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel.
      But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon
      my tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and
      stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind.</p></font>
